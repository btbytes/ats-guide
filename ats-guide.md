This notebook started as journal of my self-directed attempt to learn ATS and
use it for practical programming. You can contribute improvements
on [github](https://github.com/btbytes/ats-guide).


## Why ATS?

It is one thing to be able to write a program in a language without ever
caring how to do the same to write an entire application, a script "in
anger".

But is altoghter a different proposition to write a living software that
is expected to be used and maintained for many years when the initial
euphoria for "trying out" a new language has worn out. Specifications
are forgotten, design documents are lost to bit rot and there is the
inevitable loss of "trial knowledge" due to developer attrition.

Anyway, coming to ATS: there has been much work on the importance of
using formal verification methods to build software. However, these
methods haven't been adopted widely. One reason could be that there
appeared to be a chasm betweeen the tools used in formal methods and
those of the "work-a-day" programmer. ATS takes a programmer-centric
approach to program verification that combines programming with
theorem-proving using the same language syntax. Thus, ATS unifies
implementation with formal specification. The name ATS stands for
*Advanced Type System*.

ATS combines the practicality of low-level, system programming with many
decades of proven computer science research and development. In general,
if you want to develop safe, verifiable(?) and highly performant
software, ATS might be a good choice.

ATS plays well with the C ecosystem in that it is possible to use C
libraries, in many cases adding additional protection not offered by C.

ATS generates C code which can be shipped without the need for
additional runtime. By this virtue, the programmer can continue to
develop software using the safety and performance offered by the ATS
system without having to worry about runtime performance issues,
compatibility with downstream users etc.,.
