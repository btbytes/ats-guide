This guide is an effort to provide developers interested
in devloping programs, libraries and applications using the
ATS programming language. The goal of this guide to provide
a handbook to the installation, configuration and usage of
ATS on a daily basis.

This guide is under active development. You can contribute improvements
on [github](https://github.com/btbytes/ats-guide) or
[gitlab](https://gitlab.com/btbytes/ats-guide/).


## Why ATS?
